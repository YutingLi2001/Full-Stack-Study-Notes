The IBM Full Stack Software Developer capstone project is designed to be completed within approximately 4 months if you allocate about 3 hours per week, totaling around 143 hours of work. The capstone project encompasses the application of knowledge gained throughout the course, covering a range of technologies such as CSS, HTML, JavaScript, DevOps, and SQL, and it culminates in a GitHub portfolio that you can present to potential employers.

For a development plan, you may want to follow these steps:

1. **Outline Project Requirements**: Understand the capstone project's requirements and objectives.
2. **Allocate Time Efficiently**: Plan regular work sessions, dedicating at least 3 hours per week to the project.
3. **Set Milestones**: Break down the project into smaller tasks with deadlines to keep track of your progress.
4. **Apply Skills Learnt**: Ensure you apply the full range of skills from front-end to back-end development.
5. **Review and Iterate**: Regularly review your work against the project's requirements and iterate as needed.
6. **Finalize and Test**: Once your project is complete, thoroughly test its functionality.
7. **Prepare for Presentation**: Organize your GitHub repository and prepare to present your project to potential employers or peers.

This plan follows the recommended pace and integrates the hands-on nature of the course for a practical learning experience.
