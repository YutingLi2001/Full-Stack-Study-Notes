Virtual Machines (VMs) and containers are both methods to deploy applications and services in an isolated environment, but they do so in fundamentally different ways, with distinct advantages and disadvantages.

**Virtual Machines (VMs):**

1. **Isolation:** VMs provide full isolation by emulating a complete hardware stack. Each VM runs its own operating system.
   
2. **Overhead:** VMs have a higher overhead because each VM runs a full copy of an operating system on top of the physical server's operating system, managed by a hypervisor (like VMware or Hyper-V).

3. **Resource Allocation:** ==Resources are allocated to each VM and are not shared between VMs==, which can lead to inefficient use of resources.

4. **Portability:** While VMs are more portable than bare metal, they are less portable than containers because of their size and the need for a compatible hypervisor.

5. **Boot Time:** VMs usually take longer to boot because they have to load the entire operating system.

**Containers:**

1. **Isolation:** Containers share the same operating system kernel and isolate the application processes from the rest of the system. This is achieved through features like Linux cgroups and namespaces.

2. **Overhead:** Containers are more lightweight as they don’t include operating system images. They share the host system’s kernel, which makes them smaller and faster to start than VMs.

3. **Resource Allocation:** Containers can share resources more effectively; they can be spun up only with the necessary binaries and libraries.

4. **Portability:** Containers are highly portable because they can run anywhere: on your personal computer, on-premises servers, or in the cloud.

5. **Boot Time:** Containers start almost instantly because they don’t need to boot an OS.

**In summary:**

- VMs are better for tasks that require complete isolation, full OS functionality, or running multiple different operating systems.
- Containers are better for microservice architectures, where applications are broken down into smaller, independent pieces that can be deployed and managed dynamically.
- VMs are managed by a hypervisor, whereas containers are managed by a container runtime (like Docker) and orchestration tools (like Kubernetes).
